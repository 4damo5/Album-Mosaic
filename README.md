# Album-Mosaic

Uses Spotify API and PIL (pillow) to compile album covers from a playlist and put them in a collage-like mosaic

Make sure to set environment variables and create a Spotify App on the Spotify for Developers page

You can use both version of the mosaic (phone background version and square) by altering the end of the code 

Make sure you change the playlist ID as well
